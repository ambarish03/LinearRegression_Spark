# LinearRegression_Spark
In this project, we analyzed a subset of the Million Song Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our goal was to develop a linear regression model to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features. Each record in the dataset was modeled using SparkML's LabeledPoint which allows the feature set and the label corresponding to each instance to be stored as an array. In the next step, we develop a linear regression model and obtain the parameter estimates using two different approaches. The first of this includes an iterative approach wherein the regression coefficients are calculated using the gradient descent method and the latter involves SparkML's linear regression implementation in conjunction with elastic net regularization.
